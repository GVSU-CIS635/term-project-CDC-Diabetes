# Background

To help us compare our findings from the association rule, we will use logistic regression to analyse our data

## Libraries

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(readr)
library(stringr)
library(googledrive)
```

## Importing Data

```{r}
drive_auth()
drive_user()
cdc2015 <-  drive_get(as_id("1ErZqM-IevlEYdDejLP5-oHikMXsHDCmg"))
drive_download(cdc2015, overwrite = TRUE)
```
```{r}
cdc <- read_csv("2015.csv")
```
```{r}
# Selecting variables of interest
cdc2015 <- cdc |>
  select('DIABETE3', '_RFHYPE5', 'TOLDHI2', '_CHOLCHK', '_BMI5','SMOKE100',
         'CVDSTRK3', '_MICHD', '_TOTINDA', '_FRTLT1', '_VEGLT1', '_RFDRHV5', 
         'HLTHPLN1', 'MEDCOST', 'GENHLTH', 'MENTHLTH', 'PHYSHLTH', 'DIFFWALK',
        'SEX', '_AGEG5YR', 'EDUCA', 'INCOME2')

# Renaming the variables
cdc2015 <- cdc2015 |>
  dplyr::rename(Diabetes_012 = DIABETE3, HighBP = `_RFHYPE5`, HighChol = TOLDHI2, CholCheck = '_CHOLCHK',
        BMI = '_BMI5', Smoker = SMOKE100, Stroke = CVDSTRK3, HeartDiseaseorAttack = '_MICHD',
         PhysActivity = '_TOTINDA', Fruits = '_FRTLT1', Veggies = '_VEGLT1', HvyAlcoholConsump = '_RFDRHV5',
        AnyHealthcare = 'HLTHPLN1', NoDocbcCost = MEDCOST, GenHlth = GENHLTH, MentHlth = MENTHLTH,    
         PhysHlth = PHYSHLTH, DiffWalk = DIFFWALK, Sex = SEX, Age = '_AGEG5YR', Education = EDUCA,
        Income = INCOME2)
```

# Data Preprocessing

## Data Cleaning

```{r}
# Removing missing values
cdc2015 <- na.omit(cdc2015)

# Removing duplicates
cdc2015 <- distinct(cdc2015)
```

## Selection of Variables

```{r}
cdc_five <- cdc2015 |>
  select('Diabetes_012','HighChol','Smoker','MentHlth','Education','Income')
```

## Removing outliers

These are the different values that are assigned. We are more interested into values that provide clear answers for the sake of the study. For example, Diabetes_012 has the following values:

1 Yes
2 Yes, but female told only during pregnancy
3 No
4 No, pre-diabetes or borderline diabetes
7 Don’t know/Not Sure
9 Refused
The values 7 and 9 are considered not relevant for the dataset as we can't assume their true value.

```{r}
# Removing 7 & 9 from Diabetes_012
cdc_five <- cdc_five |>
  filter(Diabetes_012 != 7 & Diabetes_012 != 9)
```

We now have 4 values left for Diabetes_012. Based on the BRFSS 2015 dataset, we can bin the values into 3 categories

Category 0: No Diabetes (values 2 and 3)

Category 1: Prediabetes (value 4)

Category 2: Diabetes (value 1)

Reference

1 Yes
2 Yes, but female told only during pregnancy
3 No
4 No, pre-diabetes or borderline diabetes
The value 2 is not considered as a chronic diabetes as it happened only during pregnancy.

```{r}
# Replacing values for Category 0, Category 1, Category 2
cdc_five <- cdc_five |>
              mutate(Diabetes_012 = case_when(
              Diabetes_012 == 2 ~ 0,
              Diabetes_012 == 3 ~ 0,
              Diabetes_012 == 4 ~ 1,
              Diabetes_012 == 1 ~ 2,
              TRUE ~ Diabetes_012))

table(cdc_five$Diabetes_012)
```
These are the different values for MentHlth. The values mean how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good? We are more interested into values that provide clear answers for the sake of the study.

1 - 30 Number of days
88 None
77 Don’t know/Not sure
99 Refused
The values 77 and 99 are considered not relevant for the dataset as we can't assume their true value.

and the value 88 will be changed to 0 meaning no days of bad mental health in the last 30 days.

```{r}
# Removing 77 & 99 from MentHlth
cdc_five <- cdc_five |>
  filter(MentHlth != 77 & MentHlth != 99)

# Replacing 88 with 0
cdc_five <- cdc_five |>
              mutate(MentHlth = case_when(
              MentHlth == 88 ~ 0,
              TRUE ~ MentHlth))
```

Changing the smoker variable as well

```{r}
# Removing 7 & 9 from Smoker
cdc_five <- cdc_five |>
  filter(Smoker != 7 & Smoker != 9)

# Replacing 2 with 0
cdc_five <- cdc_five |>
              mutate(Smoker = case_when(
              Smoker == 2 ~ 0,
              TRUE ~ Smoker))
```

Changing the Education variable

```{r}
# Removing 7 & 9 from Education
cdc_five <- cdc_five |>
  filter(Education != 9)
```

Changing the Income variable

```{r}
# Removing 77 & 99 from Income
cdc_five <- cdc_five |>
  filter(Income != 77 & Income != 99)
```

Cleaning Cholesterol

```{r}
# Removing 7 & 9 from Cholesterol
cdc_five <- cdc_five |>
  filter(HighChol != 7 & HighChol != 9)

# Replacing 2 with 0
cdc_five <- cdc_five |>
              mutate(HighChol = case_when(
              HighChol == 2 ~ 0,
              TRUE ~ HighChol))
```
